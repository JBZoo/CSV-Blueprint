name: Complite list of preset features
description: This schema contains all the features of the presets.

presets:
  # The basepath for the preset is `.` (current directory of the current schema file).
  # Define alias "db" for schema in `./preset_database.yml`.
  db: preset_database.yml         # Or `db: ./preset_database.yml`. It's up to you.

  # For example, you can use a relative path.
  users: ./../schema-examples/preset_users.yml

  # Or you can use an absolute path.
  # db: /full/path/preset_database.yml

filename_pattern:
  preset: users                   # Take the filename pattern from the preset.

csv:
  preset: users                   # Take the CSV settings from the preset.

columns:
  # Use name of column from the preset.
  # "db" is alias. "id" is column `name` in `preset_database.yml`.
  - preset: 'db/id'

  # Use column index. "db" is alias. "0" is column index in `preset_database.yml`.
  - preset: 'db/0'
  - preset: 'db/0:'

  # Use column index and column name. It useful if column name is not unique.
  - preset: 'db/0:id'

  # Use only `rules` of "status" column from the preset.
  - name: My column
    rules:
      preset: 'db/status'

  # Override only `aggregate_rules` from the preset.
  # Use only `aggregate_rules` of "id" column from the preset.
  # We strictly take only the very first column (index = 0).
  - name: My column
    aggregate_rules:
      preset: 'db/0:id'

  # Combo!!! If you're a risk-taker or have a high level of inner zen. :)
  # Creating a column from three other columns.
  # In fact, it will merge all three at once with key replacement.
  - name: Crazy combo!
    description: >                # Just a great advice.
      I like to take risks, too.
      Be careful. Use your power wisely.
    example: ~                    # Ignore inherited "example" value. Set it `null`.
    preset: 'users/login'
    rules:
      preset: 'users/email'
      not_empty: true             # Disable the rule from the preset.
    aggregate_rules:
      preset: 'db/0'
