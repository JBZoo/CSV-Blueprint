name: Complite list of preset features
description: This schema contains all the features of the presets.

presets:
  # The basepath for the preset is `.` (current directory)
  # Define alias "db" for schema in `./preset_database.yml`
  db: preset_database.yml         # Or just `db: preset_database.yml`. It's up to you.

  # For example, you can use a relative path
  users: ./../schema-examples/preset_users.yml

  # Or you can use an absolute path
  # db-3: /full/path/preset_database.yml

  # Or you can use an absolute path
  # db: /full/path/preset_database.yml

filename_pattern:
  preset: users                   # Take the filename pattern from the preset

csv:
  preset: users                   # Take the CSV settings from the preset

columns:
  # Use name of column from the preset. "db" is alias. "id" is column `name` in `preset_database.yml`
  - preset: 'db/id'

  # Use column index. "db" is alias. "0" is column index in `preset_database.yml`
  - preset: 'db/0'
  - preset: 'db/0:'

  # Use column index and column name. It useful if column name is not unique.
  - preset: 'db/0:id'

  # Override only `rules` from the preset
  - name: My column
    rules:
      preset: 'db/status'

  # Override only `aggregate_rules` from the preset
  - name: My column
    aggregate_rules:
      preset: 'db/0:id'

  # Combo.  If you're a risk-taker or have a high level of inner zen. :)
  # Creating a column from three other columns. In fact, it will merge all three at once with key replacement.
  - name: Crazy combo!
    example: ~
    preset: 'users/login'
    rules:
      preset: 'users/email'
    aggregate_rules:
      preset: 'db/0'
